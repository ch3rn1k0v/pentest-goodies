# Pentest Everything

This is my penetration testing cheatsheet.

_I initially created this cheatsheet for the 2021 **OSCP** exam, but it is **no longer comprehensive** since the exam
was drastically changed in early 2022._

[Github-md-toc-generator](https://github.com/maksyche/github-md-toc-generator) is used to generate Tables of Contents.
