# Pentest Everything

_I initially created this cheatsheet for the **OSCP** exam, but it is **no longer comprehensive** since the exam 
was drastically changed in early 2022. However, it may still be useful for pentesting, CTFs, or just as a great 
example of exam cheatsheets._

This cheatsheet has quick guides and useful commands to enumerate and exploit low-hanging fruits and common services.
